Social media and civic engagement platforms initiated a transformation in the way communities voice their concerns and how local governments are expected to respond. Sacramento aims to set the bar for civic engagement through input and outreach platforms that better connect city officials to city change-makers.

Sacramentoâ€™s proximity to the State Capitol also provides these technologies with an opportunity to scale across jurisdictions.
