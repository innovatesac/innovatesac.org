Conveniently, Sacramento is reaching its need for a transportation infrastructure update just as emerging technologies reshape the way we view mobility. SUTL is tasked with discovering, scaling, and launching innovative transportation solutions; providing an opportunity to reshape how the city, state, nation, and even world, come to understand the new age of transportation.

Sacramentoâ€™s current transportation infrastructure is composed of a diverse array of modalities, providing the perfect testing ground for new technologies. From its downtown-grid to its tight-knit suburbs, its public transit to its commuter communities, Sacramento has it all. Yet this diverse testing ground presents a similarly diverse set of mobility issues; including access, emission, traffic fatalities and injuries, congestion, and parking. As the city moves forward, it must incorporate new technologies to solve these problems.  

Sacramento recognizes autonomous, connected, shared, and electric vehicles as the next frontier of transportation. The city aims to advance the progress already made in the mobility space by fostering companies looking to work in Sacramento.

SUTL approaches this goal with two prongs. First, SUTL helps companies start and grow in Sacramento through pilots and local permitting. Second, SUTL leverages the full force of its ties to regional developers, the California Mobility Center, UC Davis, Regional Transit, Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG), Autonomous Transportation Open Standards Lab (ATOS), and the California State Legislature.
