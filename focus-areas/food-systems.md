Agriculture is a huge engine in our region and Sacramento’s Farm to Fork movement is growing as local restaurants and stores are being more deliberate in sourcing food locally. As residents embrace community gardens and farmer’s markets, to truly become America’s Farm to Fork capitol, we need to take into consideration where our food is grown, produced, and distributed. Truly understanding these things will help address larger issues such as food deserts, air pollution caused by food transportation, and access to healthy eating choices.
