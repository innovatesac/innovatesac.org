As the hotbed for the world’s most advanced environmental policymaking, Sacramento established itself as a leader and market maker in the clean tech and sustainability space. The City understands the close ties between economic prosperity and environmental conservation and looks to advance these goals simultaneously.  

Sacramento’s position as a policy hub and budding delta city offers a unique setting to launch and scale clean technologies. Sacramento’s Urban Technology Lab can provide the resources for clean tech to launch on its grid or in its ecosystems, and can also help push evidence driven policy that expands the market for such technologies to scale.
