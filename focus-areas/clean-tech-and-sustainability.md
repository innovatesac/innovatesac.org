According to the EPA’s Framework for Sustainability, “current patterns of economic and social development are placing pressures upon natural resources, and may threaten the continued health and prosperity of human societies... [and] it is clear that a significant transformation of human production and consumption patterns will be needed in order to enable continued economic growth while protecting critical environmental resources.” The City of Sacramento has been a leader in our region in moving towards sustainability and livability and there is a broadening public interest in sustainability and clean tech throughout the world.
