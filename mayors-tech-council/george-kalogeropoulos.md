<p>George Kalogeropoulos is the CEO and one of three co-founders of HealthSherpa, a Sacramento-based startup that streamlines enrollment through the individual health plan marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. Kalogeropoulos got his start in tech after he moved across country from Connecticut to join his fianc√© (now wife), who was pursuing a law degree in the Bay Area. After connecting with a mutual friend and fellow Yale graduate, Ning Liang, the two started developing business ideas together in 2012. One of Kalogeropoulos and Liang's first projects was OpsCost, a tool to compare the cost of procedures at different hospitals. Since 2013, HealthSherpa has connected more than a 1.5 million visitors to its website with individual health insurance plans.</p>
