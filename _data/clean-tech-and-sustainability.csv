Olli,clean-tech-and-sustainability,"""In early 2019, SUTL and California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State) commenced a pilot with Local Motorâ€™s Olli, a 3D printed autonomous electric vehicle that can be customized according to desired routes. Sacramento is one of two test tracks for Olli shuttles, which can carry eight to 14 passengers without a steering wheel and a driver. As Jay Rogers, Local Motors co-founder and CEO put it, 'The Sacramento State campus, with its passion for sustainability and early adoption of technology, is an ideal, real-world proving ground for all that Olli has to offer. And, this deployment puts Olli at the doorstep of a generation of young adults who will play a significant role in moving autonomous technology forward.'""",https://localmotors.com/meet-olli/,olli,https://www.csus.edu/news/articles/2019/8/1/Despite-some-wrinkles-Olli-experiment-judged-a-success.shtml
