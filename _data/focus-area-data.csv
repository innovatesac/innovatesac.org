ATOS,mobility,"""The City launched the Autonomous Transportation Open Standards LAB (ATOS) in 2017 to make it a testing ground for future urban mobility from both a technology and policy perspective. So far, ATOS has resulted in partnerships and pilots with companies like Deepen AI, Foresight AI, Olli, Phantom Auto, and Kiwi. It also enabled companies to pilot their projects near policymakers who could pass enabling rules and regulations and serve as ongoing autonomy allies. In conjunction with the California Mobility Center, ATOS is working to create a regulatory environment to make it easy for companies to test their products in Sacramento.

Deepen.ai Mapping,mobility,"""The City of Sacramento recently partnered with Deepen.ai to use the company’s 2D and 3D annotation technology on a project designed to speed the development and safe deployment of autonomous vehicle technology for the benefit of the city. The Deepen team will annotate ground data captured by Foresight AI’s drones, which are deployed with advanced sensing technologies, such as lidar, cameras, survey-grade GPS, and inertial measurement units. Foresight AI, a Deepen partner, will process the multi-sensor data collected over the designated routes and generate high-definition, highly-accurate, colorized, 3D maps.

Safety Pool,mobility,"""In 2020, SUTL and Deepen.AI expanded their partnership by joining forces as part of SafetyPool. Safety Pool creates one central location that collects autonomous vehicle data to share among major stakeholders of self-driving technologies. The City is excited to be the first government agency to partner with Safety Pool to improve the development of safer autonomous vehicles and establish a consensus on operational safety. By partnering with Safety Pool, cities can inform regulatory best practices and enable faster adoption of safe autonomous technologies.

Phantom Auto,mobility,"""In 2018, Sacramento partnered with Phantom Auto to prepare the city to support teleoperation safety technology for driverless vehicles. California law forbids AV companies from conducting driverless testing on public roads unless they utilize remote operators like Phantom Auto. Sacramento’s partnership with Phantom Auto fits with its strategy of establishing itself as a prime testing ground for new mobility technologies, including the safe deployment of AVs. The effort has been spearheaded by Mayor Darrell Steinberg, U.S. Rep. Doris Matsui, Sen. Richard Pan and Sacramento Kings co-owner and Chairman Vivek Ranadivé.""",https://phantom.auto/,phantom,
UC Davis ITS,mobility,"""Sacramento benefits from the internationally renowned UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS). ITS studies a wide range of transportation issues ranging from transportation behavior to safety and electrification. ITS makes the Sacramento region a hotspot for transportation companies looking for validation studies and research to support evidence based policy. """,https://its.ucdavis.edu/,its,
Olli,clean-tech-and-sustainability,"""In early 2019, SUTL and California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State) commenced a pilot with Local Motor’s Olli, a 3D printed autonomous electric vehicle that can be customized according to desired routes. Sacramento is one of two test tracks for Olli shuttles, which can carry eight to 14 passengers without a steering wheel and a driver. As Jay Rogers, Local Motors co-founder and CEO put it, 'The Sacramento State campus, with its passion for sustainability and early adoption of technology, is an ideal, real-world proving ground for all that Olli has to offer. And, this deployment puts Olli at the doorstep of a generation of young adults who will play a significant role in moving autonomous technology forward.'""",https://localmotors.com/meet-olli/,olli,https://www.csus.edu/news/articles/2019/8/1/Despite-some-wrinkles-Olli-experiment-judged-a-success.shtml
Broccoli HQ,food-systems,"""One of the community building approaches the City took in relation to Food Systems is working with the Sacramento City Unified School District and the Food Literacy Center, to build a 2.5-acre student garden and food literacy center called 'Broccoli HQ' at a local school. Broccoli HQ offers after-school food literacy programs when classes include topics ranging from cooking, nutrition, food culture and cuisine to composting and identifying beneficial insects. Funded by numerous local and international businesses and organizations, Broccoli HQ’s economically disadvantaged student population comes largely from the adjacent housing projects.""",https://www.foodliteracycenter.org/,broccoli,
UrbanLeap,government-policy-and-civic-tech,"""One of SUTL’s first civic tech projects was assisting in the development of UrbanLeap, a platform that enables cities to intake proposals and translate them into trackable pilot projects. UrbanLeap now has a scalable product with nationwide customers. """,http://www.urbanleap.io/,urbanleap,
Reviver,internet-of-things-iot-and-cybersecurity,"""In 2019, Sacramento became the first city to test and deploy digital license plates when Reviver, creator of the world’s first digital license plate, commenced a pilot using City vehicles. Reviver’s innovative technology transforms the 125-year old traditional license plate into a multi-functional digital display and connected vehicle platform to make driving safer and smarter. Features include automated registration renewals, charity plate options, personal messages, vehicle locator, safety alerts, stolen vehicle information, payment solutions for parking and tolls, and marketing capabilities.""",https://www.reviver.com/,reviver,https://innovatesac.org/focus-areas/mobility/
Talent,health-it-and-life-sciences,"""Sacramento sits at the center of our region’s health sciences innovation centers. With University of California Davis Medical Center and other major healthcare researchers and providers pushing the envelope on life science innovation and California State University Sacramento as a statewide leader for the training of clinical lab technicians and scientists, there is no shortage of homegrown talent in the field.
