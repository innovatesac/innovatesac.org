            approach to Economic Development. It’s ideal for second-stage entrepreneurs
            because it focuses on critical strategic challenges they’re wrestling
            with - from developing new markets and refining business models to
            assessing competitive intelligence.  It differs from the types of
            business assistance that are traditionally offered by consultants.

            gardening specialist point them to new opportunities they may never
            have thought of on their own. Selected companies will have access to
            a suite of high-end, high-speed development tools.</p>
